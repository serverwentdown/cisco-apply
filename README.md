A simple tool to apply IOS configuration written in files to a serial port. 
Some work-in-progress [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/serverwentdown/cisco-ios-apply) 
is available for the additional syntax this tool offers, but otherwise you're
on your own for now. 

I'm working on this in my "free" time in the SIT ICT lab, so I don't have much 
time for documentation yet. I still need to do my labs after all.
